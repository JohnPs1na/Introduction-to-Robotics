## Homework 2

### Semaphore simulator, button control

As a pedestrian I want to cross the road, but it is too annoying to wait for the green light to turn on \n
Here is the solution to this problem
A button which when pressed, signals that there are people wishing to cross the road 
After it is pressed within 5 seconds, the yellow led turns on, and after another 3 seconds you can peacefully get to the other side
The semaphore also comes with sound effects which are quiet in my implementation but doesn't lose their functionality
When there is few time remaining to cross the road, the led will continuously blink and will emit repeating tick sounds so you can hurry up
