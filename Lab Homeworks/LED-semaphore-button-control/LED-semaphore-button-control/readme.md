## Homework 2

### Semaphore simulator, button control

As a pedestrian I want to cross the road, but it is too annoying to wait for the green light to turn on <br>
Here is the solution to this problem <br>
A button which when pressed, signals that there are people wishing to cross the road <br>
After it is pressed within 5 seconds, the yellow led turns on, and after another 3 seconds you can peacefully get to the other side <br>
The semaphore also comes with sound effects which are quiet in my implementation but doesn't lose their functionality <br>
When there is few time remaining to cross the road, the led will continuously blink and will emit repeating tick sounds so you can hurry up<br>
