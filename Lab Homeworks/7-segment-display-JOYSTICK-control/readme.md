# Homework 3

Ever looked at your grandma calculator and admired those beautiful displayed numbers?
Or solved puzzles containing matches? and constructed those digits using different match positioning?

Well this project digitalize it for you

You can now write ANYTHING on the seven segment display just by Using a simple joystick

1. starting on the decimal point you have one option to go to the left on the proper display
2. you can chose any part of the display and change it's light intensity (on/off)
  - how you do that??
  - well you choose a segment and short press your joystick
  - it then goes in the "change intensity state" 
  - from here you either move your joystick up (on) or down (off) to change intensities
3. if you want to do another combination, simply long press the joystick button
